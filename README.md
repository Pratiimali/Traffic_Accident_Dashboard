## 📝 Description

This project was developed as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau dashboarding proficiency** in transforming raw traffic accident data into meaningful, decision-ready insights. The dashboard replicates a real-world traffic monitoring scenario where operational and safety teams can track key metrics, analyze severity patterns, and take targeted, data-driven actions to improve road safety and traffic management strategies.
